# Vehicle-detection-using-OpenCV
<h3> A basic Computer Vision project for tracking vehicle </h3>

This is my 1st Computer Vision project using OpenCV.

<b>OpenCV</b>, the Open Source Computer Vision Library, is a powerful open-source software library used extensively in computer vision and machine learning applications. With its wide range of functionalities for image and video analysis, processing, and manipulation, OpenCV has become a popular choice for developers and researchers in the field of computer vision.

This project focuses on creating a vehicle detection program using <b>OpenCV in Python</b>.The vehicle will get detected when comming towards the camera and a rectangles will be drawn around them for visual identification. Additionally, we are counting the number of the vehicle and store the info in a <b>'csv'</b> file with real time.
